# boilerplate-vanilla-spa :bread: (bread)
My boilerplate for a vanilla js spa, the main goal of this is to build an SPA with just pure javascript
no dependecies needed, yet, just run with:

```
  npm start
```

and your are good to go.

I had to write my own little server to serve all the file requested, it may have some bug but getting there slowly

This doesn't have a compiler(minify, uglify?) cause the way it is intented to be, i can't install any dependency,
so, maybe have to do it manualy

I keep working on this

please put a little **star** on it if you feel like doing it :wink:

minor bug not resolved (yet!):
- changing route add more history than needed

it have hot reload BUT you should run
```
npm install
```
for it to run, however this can still work without you downloading it.

I'm working on implementing a little web socket so i'll throw up the 'ws'.
