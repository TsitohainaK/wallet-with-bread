# Views :eye:

It is suggered to make a folder for each views.

## Creating a view
- create a folder by the name of the view
- create a file named `{name}_view.js`

in the `{name}_view.js` we have just to make an export default of a fumction that return the `createComponent` function in the **core**, and then you can create any element by using `e` function in the **virtualDom**.

It should look like this:

``` js
import { createComponent } from "../../../core/component/index.js";
import { e } from "../../../core/virtualDom/index.js";

export default () => createComponent(() => {
  return e("h1", { id: "title" }, 'Hello, world');
});

```

### The **createComponent** function
As its name it is for creating component

**the first argument is a callback function** that will return the elements created using `e` or creating it manualy (e.g: using `document.createElement`)

**the second argument take an exact path** it will point to a script file that handle the view's logic, this argument is optional, if we have the third argument but doesn't need a script file, we can just put and empty string on it.

**the third argument is an array or string of exact path** pointing to css file that need to be imported

### The **e** function
`e` stand for element(html) and it is for creating them

It take three (3) arguments **tagName**,**attributes** and **childs**

- **tagName** are for the element tag wich is a string

- **attributes** is an object containing all the element's attribute, can be leaved as an empty object

- **childs** it can be just literal string or another element or even array of elements

here an exemple of all of that:

``` js

export default () => createComponent(() => {
  return e("nav", { id: "navbar" }, [
    e("h1",{id:'brand'},'Bread'),
    e("a",{href:'contact'},'Contact me')]
  );
},'src/views/{name}/{name}_script.js','src/views/{name}/{name}.css');

```

## Handling script (interaction with the view)

Although you create the view in a Js file you cant interact with the html you return, yet you can do things like getting data before creating the element and assining it to an element.

```js
export default () => createComponent(() => {
  // getting data from localStorage
  const name = localStorage.getItem('username');

  return e("div", { id: "user" },
    e("h1",{id:'name'},`Welcome ${name}`)
  );
})
```

**In the `{name}_script.js` file** you can then handle the component and its childs script. In a script file you may use `select()` function given in the `core/virtualDom/index.js` it select and return for you the element you want in the callback props by it's **#id** so it save you a few line and help for a better readability.

as exemple
``` js
import { select } from "../../../core/virtualDom/index.js";

select("home", (home) => {
  let i = 0;

  select("btn", (btn) => {
    btn.onclick = () => {
      btn.innerHTML = ++i;
    }
  });
});
```
